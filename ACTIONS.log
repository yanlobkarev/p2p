1)  Installing ubuntu16 on VirtualBox (http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent) 
    UnuntuBox->Devices->Insert Guest Additions CD
    Set bidirectional clipboard in UbuntuBox Setting->General->Advanced 
    Restart UnutuBox, Open Terminal:

    #   Install pip
    curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py 
    sudo python get-pip.py

    #   Install requirements    
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt 

    #   Install Vim
    mkdir ~/.vim/colors
    sudo apt-get install vim git
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    wget -O ~/.vimrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanlobkarev/yscripts/master/.vimrc
    wget -O ~/.vim/colors/moonshine.vim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKPMW/moonshine-vim/master/colors/moonshine.vim
    #   vim->:PluginInstall->:qa!

2)  #   Didn't found out how to set custom tty width/height. 
    #   Shit!
    # gonna switch off gnome followinf dat instruction ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1661065 )  Do I ?

3)  #   Disable animations
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool    
    unity-tweak-tool  # uncheck animations

    sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
    ccsm  # uncheck animations as much as possible

4)  #   Add Shared folders Setting->Shared folders->plus->
    #       check make permanent
    #       check auto-mount
    #       select Path %code%
    #       ->Ok
    #   Restart UbuntuBox
    sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf $(whoami) #   Restart UnutuBox again
    cd /media/sf_%code%

5)  Fix UbuntuBox swallows cmd+Tab keys (very annoying for Mac users)
    VirtualBox->Preferences->Input Tab->uncheck Auto Capture Keyboard

6)  Wrote a simple server & signal-server using following 
    example https://habrahabr.ru/post/304150/

7)  Creating a new UbuntuBox2 (new VirtualBox instance)
    Shit just didn't worked out from the first time. 
    (client has server's nat address, but server doesn't 
    receive messages from client). Meh, going to sleep.

8)  Installed STUN server on host machine:
    npm install https://github.com/keyneom/stun.git
    Anyway it didn't worked out(( UbuntuBox behind NAT 
    reports NAT type `Blocked`. Shit!

9)  Setup TeamViewer on my work machine: NAT type `Full Cone`.
    On my home machine: NAT type `Symmetric NAT`.
    On my work machine: ./echoer.py (UDP echo server on 9999 port).

10) Got some beer. Did shit. Also bought 2$ VPS.
    Worked if chat_server.py behind `Full Cone NAT`.
    And chat_client.py behind `Symmetric NAT`.
    Attached fancy colored prompt to chat.
    Scanning shit for PEP8 issues. Seems to be, twisted
    coding styles (method naming) contradicts to PEP8.
